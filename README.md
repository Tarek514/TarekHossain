## Featured Projects
### [Empower Your Fitness Journey](https://group-f-final-project.vercel.app/)
This project necessitated collaborative teamwork to develop a sophisticated business website. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Agile, and NodeJS, as well as harnessing the power of Google Analytics, we meticulously crafted an engaging online platform. Our website features diverse sections comprising informative articles, a robust privacy policy, and a dynamic blog page.

### [Portfolio Project](https://github.com/Tarek514/webdev1_final_individual)
Using Agile web development with Nextjs, I made a portfolio website that has sections dedicated to introducing myself, my professional experience, projects, skillset, and a contact me section. I integrated MailChimp into my project so whenever anyone signs up to contact me, they will be redirected to MailChimp where they can fill out a form to get in touch with me. Furthermore, I've harnessed the power of Google Analytics, enabling real-time tracking of website traffic and user interaction. This invaluable tool provides insightful data on the number of visitors and how they engage with the content, empowering me to continuously refine and improve the user experience.
