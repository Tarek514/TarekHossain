## About Me
I am a recent graduate with a degree in Information Technology from New Jersey Institute of Technology, eager to launch my career as a frontend web developer. I have built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, and jQuery through hands-on projects and Udemy courses. My experience includes designing responsive websites, optimizing user interfaces, and implementing modern web practices. 

During my tenure as a Customer Service Agent at Emirates via Hallmark Aviation from August 2022 to January 2023, I enhanced my skills in active listening, engaged with customers, and delivered exceptional service. This role sharpened my ability to adapt, resolve issues, and communicate effectively, which I now apply to my web development projects. 

In my spare time, I dedicate myself to advancing my web development skills through Udemy courses. These courses have empowered me to create a diverse array of projects, showcasing my proficiency in front-end development. I am excited to leverage my technical skills, contribute to innovative projects, and collaborate with a team committed to delivering exceptional user experiences.

## Featured Projects
### [Initial Portfolio Project](https://my-portfolio-kappa-two-32.vercel.app/)
This is my portfolio built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, highlighting my skills, experiences, and projects in a clean and user-friendly design. It includes sections on my background, work experience at Hallmark Aviation, relevant education, and a portfolio of projects, with links for more details. The site also features a contact form powered by Web3Forms and integrated Google Analytics to track user interaction for continuous improvement.

### [Empower Your Fitness Journey](https://group-f-final-project.vercel.app/)
This project necessitated collaborative teamwork to develop a sophisticated business website. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Agile, and NodeJS, as well as harnessing the power of Google Analytics, we meticulously crafted an engaging online platform. Our website features diverse sections comprising informative articles, a robust privacy policy, and a dynamic blog page.

### [Robo-Search React App](https://tarek514.github.io/Robo-Search/)
This is a Robo-search project built using React where users can search through a list of robots by typing into a search bar, dynamically filtering the displayed robot cards based on the search input. It has components such as a search bar, card, and card list to name a few that come with state management to handle the search functionality. The data and the images of the robots are retrieved using two different APIs; one provides the names and emails while the other creates a unique robot image based on the data
